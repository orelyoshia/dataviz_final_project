# Data Visualization - Fall 2021

## Mini Project 3

In this project I was tasked with recreating charts that show the distributions of a continuous variable. We used the dataset obtained from FSU's [Florida Climate Center](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data), for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) from 2016 to 2017.

In the main folder you can find the .rmd file and the .html file of the report. There is also a files folder which contains the .png of the solutions to the visualizations I recreated.
