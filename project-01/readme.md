# Data Visualization - Fall 2021

# Mini Project 1


In this project I chose to look at a dataset generated from the Florida Department of Education, specifically the Statewide Course Numbering System that can be found in the data /data folder.

The main columns I looked at were the Disciplines, Institution, Institution_Level, Course_Desc, and Inst_Course_Desc.

In the main folder you can find the rmd file and the .html file of the final report for this project. There is also a files folder where you can find the .png images from the report.

The point of this project was to help students and administration see trends and patterns in these STEM courses. For students it could help them figure out if STEM is right for them. For administration, it could help guide them when making different curriculum and organizing different Majors.
