# Data Visualization - Fall 2021

## Mini Project 2

In this project I created my own dataset based on findings from  "https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=4184". Columns I included in the dataset were the university name, which school/department they are part of, the degree subject (A, BA, DA, DS), the year the degree was established, the location of the university, the degree description and the URL to their website. You can find the dataset in the /data folder.

In this project I was able to create an interactive plot, a spatial visualization, and a Topic Model using LDA. All of these visualizations were made to see the growth of Analytics, Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science MS Degrees. The map can also allow anyone to sort through about 300 schools and click their degree page based on location of the university and what subject they are interested in.

In the main folder you can find the .rmd file and the .html file of the final report for this project. You can also find a files folder which contains the .png of the visualizations in the report.
